## About My Project

Elevating Black Corpus and UX in Speech & Language Systems

We are diligently working to confront disparities and advance equity within speech recognition softwares. Historically, marginalized communities have been left out of this conversation. 

We're actively pursuing partnerships with Seattle-based local organizations, driven by our commitment to community-based participatory research techniques. These principles underpin our approach to co-designing technology solutions that empower historically marginalized communities, fostering collaboration and equity. Our immediate goal is to initiate a research project aimed at addressing racial disparities in automated speech recognition and natural language processing, specifically targeting communities of Black American English speakers.
