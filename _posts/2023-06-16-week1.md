title: Week 1

The first week of the program! We got assigned our tasks. My first task is gathering a list of organizations within the Seattle area that focus on uplifting the Black community. I am creating a chart with their contact information, mission statement, contact status (if we have already contacted them in the past), and any other relevant information. In addition, we got introduced to the groupâ€™s Notion channel, where we will organize all of our tasks and duties. Feeling good about our first week!
